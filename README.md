RFI Tracker

RFI Tracker is a web app which allows users to view RFIs for proejcts they are members of. IF the user has reated an RFI, they are able to modfiy or delete the RFI. 

A user can see a list of all projects on one page, and can add a new project if they so wish. At any point, the navbar allows the user to make a new RFI associated with a specific project. While clicking on a project allows the users to see the specific RFIs associated with the project.
